This document outlines how to search your bookmarks in the Brave Browser to quickly find any URL you need.

First, go to `brave://settings/searchEngines` and find the `Site search` section. Then, click the `Add` button. You will be presented with three text fields.

In the name field, type a relevant name for this site search; mine is Bookmarks. In the shortcut section, select a shortcut that you will use to access this feature. I personally use the letter `a`.

In the final field, type in `brave://bookmarks/?q=%s`. All of the above works as follows. In the search bar, type `a` and press space, or tab. Brave should now display the name of your search and await further input.

You can now type a search query. Whatever you type after this, will replace `%s` in the URL we added initially. For example, if you type in the word `UNIX`, the URL you will go to is `brave://bookmarks/?q=UNIX`. As a result, you should see all of the bookmarks that contain the word `UNIX`.

This will allow you to search your Brave Bookmarks faster than manually accessing them through the menu or clicking a button and then searching all your bookmark directories.
